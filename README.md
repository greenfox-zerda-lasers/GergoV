# Green Fox Academy exercises by Gergő Vámosi (geritwo)


Here you can find all the stuff I made as a Green Fox Academy apprentice in Zerda group's Lasers class (or web class - specialized in HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Node.js and an Angular.js closing project, with some OOP tinkering in Python as an intro.)

## Project/work highlights

### Elevator, or how to use MVC pattern properly?

During week 5 of our training we got introduced to the MVC design pattern. This was my favorite project back then - making a text-based elevator "simulator" in Python with the proper use of MCV and nicely structured objects.

### JS Gallery

The aim of this project was to practice vanilla JS/DOM methods in a somewhat complex, functional app. We got a layout to follow and a specified/optional functionality for the gallery.

My first attempt to make it was not successful, but in version 2 I added a server to serve front-end because I wanted to make the app able to handle file parsing. This needed a little tinkering with Express JS's static file serve functions and proper XHR requests from the front-end.

### Some useful Bash aliases

When I started to learn programming, I started to use Linux (Kubuntu 16.04 Plasma notably), beceause a few months earlier I made the swiths on my home laptop and I totally got hooked. When the course started I created a few useful bash aliases to make navigation in project files more easy.

### Algorithms

Througout the training we did mostly tinkering with practical stuff but I also felt the urge to deep into algorithm theory and started solving Project Euler exercises. This folder contains a few useful algorithms in JS and Python that I made and can re-use and study further any time.
