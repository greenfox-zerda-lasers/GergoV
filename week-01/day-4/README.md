# How I approached this #


I tried to be pixel-perfect by viewing each assignment's example image on a spearate
tab in the browser and mathed up <main> (wrapper) margins to position the build
accordingly.

In the CSS I tried to be consistent with color codes: either color names or Hexa 
codes only within one exercise.

I often left notes for myself in comments in the CSS about the example. I used no
ASCII art or swear words here. ;)

My main problem was that I couldn't measire many sizes correctly thus I ended up
comparing the build with the example besides each other in two different tabs.
